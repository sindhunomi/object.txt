I love to motivate and coordinate people.I can speak telugu,hindi,english,kannada languages.
listening to music is my cup of tea especially I am very fond of folk music.
I am a hardworker,with a dedicated soul towards my responsibility.
what ever the work which is given to me I do it with my heart and soul together,
I leave no stone to complete it.I have also coordinated many programs in our college.
my hobbies are:listening to music,cooking,drawing pictures.
and I love to travel around the world.my stength is that I'll never miss an oppurtunity that leads to my success.
